1. Configure Mosquitto to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

Locate your mosquitto.conf file

Typically found in one of these locations:

Windows: C:\Program Files\mosquitto\mosquitto.conf
Windows (alternate): C:\mosquitto\mosquitto.conf




Edit the configuration file

Open the file with a text editor (like Notepad, run as administrator)
Look for a line that starts with listener
If it exists, modify it to: listener 1883 0.0.0.0
If it doesn't exist, add this line: listener 1883 0.0.0.0
Also ensure you have: allow_anonymous true


Save the file and restart Mosquitto

Open Services (press Win+R, type "services.msc")
Find "Mosquitto Broker" in the list
Right-click and select "Restart"
Alternatively, in command prompt (as administrator):
net stop mosquitto
net start mosquitto




2. Configure Windows Firewall to allow MQTT traffic (port 1883)

Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security


Alternative: Using the command line

Open Command Prompt as Administrator



After completing these steps, your Mosquitto broker should be accessible to devices on your local network, including your ESP32.
